/* 
What is the problems with above design?
As you must have observed in the above example, Client creates objects of either TwoWheeler or FourWheeler based on some input during constructing its object.
Say, library introduces a new class ThreeWheeler to incorporate three wheeler vehicles also. What would happen? Client will end up chaining a new else if in the conditional ladder to create objects of ThreeWheeler. Which in turn will need Client to be recompiled. So, each time a new change is made at the library side, Client would need to make some corresponding changes at its end and recompile the code. Sounds bad? This is a very bad practice of design.

/*
In the above example, we have totally decoupled the selection of type for object creation from Client. The library is now responsible to decide which object type to create based on an input. Client just needs to make call to libraryâ€™s factory Create method and pass the type it wants without worrying about the actual implementation of creation of objects.
